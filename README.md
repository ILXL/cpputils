# C++ Utils

Libraries for student C++ code available under the MIT license.

## Graphics: Image library

``graphics/image.h`` can be used to create, view, load and save images. Example:

![example fractal tree](graphics/test/example_fractal_tree.png)

``graphics/image_event.h`` allows for interactive graphical programs with animation and mouse event handling.

### Usage

Learn more about how to use the C++ Utils graphics class in this [interactive tutorial](https://lab.cs50.io/ILXL-guides/intro-to-graphics).

## Karel the Robot in C++

Karel the Robot is a gentle introductory programming language created by [Dr. Richard Pattis](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/) in [*Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to The Art of Programming*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/ghcZAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1). The Karel language emphasizes logic while hiding tricky syntax, allowing anyone to begin making exciting graphical programs with very little background.

To create graphical Karel the Robot programs in C++, include ``karel/karel.h``.

### Usage

(TODO): Learn more about how to use the C++ Utils Karel the Robot functions in this [interactive tutorial](https://github.com/ILXL-guides/intro-to-karel)
